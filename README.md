## 🧠 System Overview

Entities are represented as nodes and interactions as relationships:

- **Account** → User
- **Product** → Item for sale
- **Shop** → Product owner

Relationships:
- `(:Account)-[:BOUGHT {count}]->(:Product)` — tracks purchase frequency  
- `(:Product)-[:FROM]->(:Shop)`

Recommendations are generated based on:
- Same **product category**
- Same **shop**
- Highest purchase **count**

📈 Recommendation Logic
When a user purchases a product, a BOUGHT relationship is created or updated.

The system analyzes:

Most purchased categories

Most purchased shops

Products with the highest interaction count are recommended.
